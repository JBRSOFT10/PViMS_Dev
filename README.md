# PViMS_Dev

* PViMS, or the PharmacoVigilance Monitoring System, is a web-based application used to monitor the safety of medicines. The application was developed by the USAID-funded Systems for Improved Access to Pharmaceuticals and Services [SIAPS] program (2011-2018) and is implemented by the USAID-funded Medicines, Technologies, and Pharmaceutical Services [MTaPS] program (2018-2023), both led by Management Sciences for Health (MSH), a global health nonprofit. PViMS is maintained by MSH.
